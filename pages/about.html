        <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
        
        <p>This profile is a part of a decentralised social media platform that I am currently developing. Devolution, or <b>Devo</b> for short, is no ordinary social media platform. It is also a decentralised governance model. You view a demo <b><a target="_blank" href="https://glensimister.github.io/devolution/">here.</a></b> And below is a screenshot:-</p>

        <p>Devo takes inspiration from a project that is currently being devloped by Tim Berners Lee, called Solid (Social Linked Data). This profile can be hosted anywhere the user chooses, whether it be Dropbox, AWS, Github, or whatever. Using this profile they can login into Devo. Devo uses a P2P in-browser Javascript database engine called GunDB to connect the profiles together. Devo doesn't actually store any data. Our posts, comments, photos, likes will be stored in our own profile. GunDB simply stores a reference to these assets. The problem with distributed databases is that they can quickly become bloated. As such, it is important to preserve space. Not only that but it is important not to lock people into one app.</p>
