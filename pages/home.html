        <h1>What's this all about?</h1>

        <p>This public profile is a part of a non-profit, open-source, decentralized governance model / social media platform called <b>Devo</b> (short for "Devolution"). You view a demo <b><a target="_blank" href="https://glensimister.github.io/devolution/">here.</a></b> This profile is under construction, however, you can login above as a guest user and you will see some extra tabs.</p>
        <p>Devo is designed to give communities / regions more political independence. It enables members to vote for officials and finance public services. Revenue comes from voting, adverts and an unofficial Land Value Tax (LVT), which I refer to as Land Value Rent (LVR). There will also be extensions / plug-ins that can be used to generate additional revenue for the application such as a casino, which includes lottery, bingo, slot machines, etc.</p>

        <p>All revenue is redistributed in the form of Social Credits, which are used to finance public services, top-up Health/Education Credits and various other activities on the platform. The application has sections for healthcare, education, business, and even has an affordable housing section. Using the application members can collectively buy land and install modular housing units (built using aluminium profile technology), as well as toilets, shower blocks, and anything else they need to live comfortably and be relatively self-sufficient. Members will then register a section of land and pay an unofficial Land Value Tax (LVT) back into the application, which is distributed to all community members in the form of Social Credits. The application has a motto, and it's one that everybody knows: </p>

        <p><i>"Give a man a fish, he feeds himself for a day, give a man the means to catch a fish, he feeds himself for a lifetime".</i></p>
        <p>TO BE CONTINUED...</p>

        <h1>Technical Explaination</h1>
        <p>This document is not designed for regular users of the application, but for developers who are interested in contributing. This project is very much under construction. After giving it much thought I decided not to use a JS framework, but instead stick to web standards. The current prototype relies on Jquery, however, I plan to replace Jquery with vanilla Javascript to make the web components more encapsulated. In terms of the core codebase, I would like to use the <a href="https://micro-frontends.org/">micro-frontend</a> methodology. Additionally, Devo will receive updates and will be extendable through plug-ins. </p>
        <p>The application will be decentralized. However, due to various technological limitations, it will most likely start off with some degree of centralization. It is important to note that the technologies that I plan to use will be subject to change, as new and improved technologies enter the game. Below are some ideas about how the platform will work, initially. </p>
        <p>The application will broken into three main components. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Public profile/resume (semi-centralized)</li>
            <li>Devo - Social media application (decentralized)</li>
            <li>Browser extension (semi-decentralized)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Public profile</h2>
        <p>Initially, the public profile will be built on <a href="https://gun.eco/">GunDB</a>. GunDB is a lightweight, P2P graph database engine written in Javascript. GunDB works both in the browser (using localstorage) or on a server (using NodeJS). The public profile itself will be hosted on a server, while Devo will use localstorage. Of course, in order for the platform to be fully decentralized, we would need some sort of decentralized storage platform that is able to host dynamic web applications. There are decentralized storage solutions, such as IPFS, however, to the best of my knowledge, IPFS can only host static content. Additionally, with IPFS it's not possible to delete data. I want to ensure that users have as much control over their data as possible, which includes the right to remove content as and when they choose. With GunDB you at least have the option to overwrite your data with NULL, which is good enough for me.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, we will need to rely on free hosting providers (for now at least), which is not an ideal solution, but a trade off. The public profile is &ldquo;semi-centralized&rdquo; because it will be hosted on a &ldquo;centralized server&rdquo;, but users can choose which server they want to host it. It thus follows a similar principal to <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com/">Solid (Social Linked Data)</a> - a project that is being developed by Tim Berners-Lee. There may be ways of automating the transfer of profiles between servers. Naturally, there are those who want less censorship, and those who want more. Storing the profiles on a centralized server provides a compromise. For example, if a user of the application is hosting illicit material, other users could report them to the hosting provider, or even report the hosting provider to the authorities. However, assuming the user hosting the data doesn't end up in jail, they could simply move their data to another server, and update their URL within Devo. In some ways I would prefer this option as it's more democratic. Not only that but I wouldn't want to derail the project by getting into trouble with the authorities.</p>
        <p>What about credentials? The hosting providers will not have access to a user's credentials as they will be managed using GunDB's built-in authentication protocol. When signing-up, users will be asked to specify X number of security questions and answers, which will be used to generate their password. If the user forgets their password, they simply answer the questions to log back in. </p>

        <h2>Devo - social media application</h2>
        <p>Devo is decentralized, as it works without a centralized server. Ideally, I would like users to be able to login to Devo using the same credentials as the public profile, which will enable them to write, edit and delete data on their profile.</p>
        <p>GunDB will not store a user's posts/comments/photos etc. Instead it stores a reference to this data on the user's public profile. GunDB uses localstorage for storing the data, which is limited in size. That said, users only store the data that they are a subscribed too, and there are adapters that can increase the size of the storage. However, given that Facebook stores about 500+ terabytes of data each day, we still need to preserve as much space as possible. So... </p>
        <p>Let's say that I comment on a post in Devo. The comment is sent to my profile, and a reference to the post is stored in GunDB. Below is a cut-down version of how the data will be stored in Gun. </p>
        
        <pre><code>
/*** posts ***/
{
    postID: the poster's post ID
    user: a circular reference to the poster in 'users' table
        comments: [{
            postID: the commenters post ID
            user: a circular reference to commenter in 'users' table
            },
            {...}]
}

/*** users ****/
publicKey: the URL of the users profile, which can updated if they move their profile
        </code></pre>
        <p>When the original poster tries to retrieve the post it will lookup the public key in the users table, find the URL of their profile, and then fetch the post according to the ID. Likewise, it will lookup the comments, find the URL of the commenter's public key and fetch the post according to the post ID. The goal is to only store the data you absolutely must store. There will be some data that may be best stored in Gun. For example, a private chat between two people might be better stored in Gun as sending a POST request to a server each time you send a message would be inefficient. </p>

        <h2>Browser extension (toolbar)</h2>
        <p>The browser extension is a toolbar that can be used beyond the confines of the application. It will allow users to like, dislike, flag, comment, donate crypto, view the author of the content, and view the score of the current page. As it stands the browser extension is called &ldquo;GiveMeCredit!&rdquo;, although that may be subject to change. GiveMeCredit! was where the original idea for Devo came from. You can view a demo of the extension at the bottom of Devo. As with Devo, the browser extension will write data to the user's profile. </p>
        
        <h2>Credits and financial transactions &ndash; the (even more) tricky bit</h2>
        <p>Initially, Devo will probably use Ethereum. I've been very hesitant to use Ethereum due to concerns about scalability, however, Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) is said to be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/joseph-lubin-on-ethereum-20-eth-to-become-1-000-times-more-scalable-within-24-months">1,000 times more scalable</a>, and it's still probably the most production-ready Smart Contract platform available. Not only that but there are a number of dapps/currencies that already exist that could be useful for Devo, some of which include:-</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="">Bancor protocol</a> : Convert any token to another, without requiring a second party to exchange with</li>
            <li><a href="">Basic attention token (BAT)</a> : Ethereum token that powers Brave browser's digital advertising platform</li>
            <li><a href="">Crypto20</a> : The first tokenized Crypto Index fund (useful for price stability)</li>
            <li><a href="">Cryptolotto</a> : A transparent lottery powered by Ethereum smart contracts</li>
            <li><a href="">FieldCoin</a> : A blockchain based land marketplace (although currently only support agricultural land)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although not related to Ethereum, I'm also interested in ULEX &ndash; an <a href="https://instituteforcompgov.org/ulex">open source legal system</a>. </p>
        <p>It should also be noted that the developers of GunDB (including one of Bitcoin's first developers) are currently developing their own cryptocurrency called AXE, which uses a &rdquo;proof-of-propagation&rdquo; consensus algorithm. </p>
        <p>As mentioned in the non-technical guide, any revenue that goes into Devo is redistributed in the form of Social Credits. These Social Credits can be used to finance various activities on the platform.</p>

        <h2>How it works...</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Each user will be required to create an account on Ethereum and pay small amount of ETH into a Smart Contract. The smart contract will create a user account which contains a number of additional fields. e.g. socialCredits, healthCredits, educationCredits, and a few others which I won't mention right now. </li>
            <li>Voting will also be done on the Ethereum Blockchain. There are several <a href="https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/full-stack-hello-world-voting-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-1-40d2d0d807c2">voting tutorials</a></li>
            <li>Any &ldquo;tax&rdquo; revenue (lottery, ads, LVT) that is paid into the application will be paid into the smart contract. We could use the Bancor protocol to ensure that the smart contract receives the payment in ETH, regardless of which ERC20 token is used to make the payment</li>
            <li>The smart contract will count the number of registered users, divide the total amount of ETH in the smart contract by the number of registered users, and update the Social Credits on each user's account on the Ethereum Blockchain. Devo will subscribe to changes and update the UI accordingly</li>
            <li>The user can donate their Social Credits to a given service (typically an elected authority). When the user donates their Social Credits, an API call is sent to the smart contract, requesting that the Social Credits (still locked in the smart contract) are transferred to the public key of the service. Naturally, the smart contract will need to verify that the public key is associated with a valid service. As before, the number of social credits in the user's account will be updated accordingly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand that sounds a bit complicated so I'll summarise...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users register with contract</li>
            <li>Users elect officials</li>
            <li>Users pay &ldquo;tax&rdquo; into contract</li>
            <li>Social Credits are distributed to each user</li>
            <li>Users donate Social Credits to officials</li>
            <li>Smart contract verifies and pays official</li>
            <li>Smart contract updates user's Social Credits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Health Credits</h2>
        <p>As mentioned, normally a user would donate their social credits to a service. When a user transfers their social credits to health credits, the social credits are &ldquo;sent back&rdquo; to the Smart Contract, and the contract updates the healthCredits field in the Blockchain. However, with health credits, there is a limit to the number of credits they can receive. I haven't yet decided how these limits would be set. Smart contracts are not typically able to access data from external sources. However, with <a href="http://provable.xyz/">Provable</a>, &ldquo;Smart contracts can directly access data from Web sites or APIs&rdquo;. This will enable us to dynamically adjust these limits through some form of democratic process. </p>
        <p>In order for health credits to be redeemed we also need a list of healthcare service providers. This list will probably be done off the blockchain, although the service provider ratings will likely be stored on the blockchain. Service providers will need to register an account, just like ordinary users, and there will be a certain criteria that needs to be met in order for them to receive health credits. Education credits work in a very similar way so I'll omit this section for now. </p>
        <p>TO BE CONTINUED...</p>
